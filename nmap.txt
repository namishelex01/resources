|  NMAP Script Categories |

auth:       This category is for scripts related to user authentication. 
            Nmap --script auth <IP>
broadcast:  This is a very interesting category of scripts that use broadcast petitions to gather information.
brute:      This category is for scripts that help conduct brute-force password auditing.
default:    This category is for scripts that are executed when a script scan is executed (-sC). 
            Nmap --script default <IP>
discovery:  This category is for scripts related to host and service discovery. This category of scripts is ideal when we need to have as much information as possible for a specific target. 
            Nmap --script discovery <IP>
dos:        This category is for scripts related to denial of service attacks.
exploit:    This category is for scripts that exploit security vulnerabilities.
external:   This category is for scripts that depend on a third-party service. performs an automatic Web Whois to the target and discovers additional information like the geographical location,the name of the organization and the net range. 
            Nmap --script external scanme.nmap.org
fuzzer:     This category is for NSE scripts that are focused on fuzzing.
intrusive:  This category is for scripts that might crash something or generate a lot of network noise. Scripts that system administrators may consider intrusive belong to this category.
malware:    This category is for scripts related to malware detection.
safe:       This category is for scripts that are considered safe in all situations. 
            Nmap --script safe <IP>
version:    This category is for scripts that are used for advanced versioning.
vuln:       This category is for scripts related to security vulnerabilities


|  NMAP IDS/IPS Evasion |

Packet Fragmentation: Evade pattern matching detection technique
                      When Fragmentation reassembly functionality is disabled
$nmap -f <TargetIP>

Append Random Data:   Spoof the data length of packet
$nmap --data-length <number-of-bytes> <IP>

Decoy Scan:           Add random hosts either from attacker's subnet or from victim's subnet
                      In logs, multiple hosts IP makes it difficult to trace the attacker
                      But first do an Idle scan of available zombie hosts
$nmap -D <IP1, IP2, IP3,...> <TargetIP>
$nmap -sI <ZombieIP> <TargetIP>
$nmap -D RND:25 <TargetIP>               <--Random IP generation-->

Spoof source IP:      Spoof the source IP (from the victim's subnet) so IDS/firewall will pass thinking as a legitimate user
$nmap -S <SpoofedIP> <TargetIP>

Spoof source port:    Bypass rules that allow requests from few ports (ex. Port 53).
$nmap --source-port <PortNumber> <IP>

Send Bad Checksum:    Check for configuration of system
$nmap --badsum <IP>

Spoof MAC Address:    Bypass MAC filtering rule
$nmap --spoof-mac <DELLorAPPLEorELSE / 0 / SPECIFIC> <IP>
                          |            |      |
                  choose vendor      random   specific

Scanning Timing:      Can be used to evade some of the rules in the firewalls or IDS.
                      Adding random order increases effectiveness of scan
                      T0 = Paranoid (Waits 5 minutes between sending each probes, not detected by IDS/IPS)
                      T1 = Sneaky (waits 15 seconds)
                      T2 = Polite
                      T3 = Normal
                      T4 = Aggressive
                      T5 = Insane (easily detectable)
$nmap --randomize-hosts -T<0-5> <TargetIP>
