broadcast:  This is a very interesting category of scripts that use broadcast petitions to gather information.
brute:      This category is for scripts that help conduct brute-force password auditing.
default:    This category is for scripts that are executed when a script scan is executed (-sC). 
            Nmap --script default <IP>
discovery:  This category is for scripts related to host and service discovery. This category of scripts is ideal when we need to have as much information as possible for a specific target. 
            Nmap --script discovery <IP>
dos:        This category is for scripts related to denial of service attacks.
exploit:    This category is for scripts that exploit security vulnerabilities.
external:   This category is for scripts that depend on a third-party service. performs an automatic Web Whois to the target and discovers additional information like the geographical location,the name of the organization and the net range. 
            Nmap --script external scanme.nmap.org
fuzzer:     This category is for NSE scripts that are focused on fuzzing.
intrusive:  This category is for scripts that might crash something or generate a lot of network noise. Scripts that system administrators may consider intrusive belong to this category.
malware:    This category is for scripts related to malware detection.
safe:       This category is for scripts that are considered safe in all situations. 
            Nmap --script safe <IP>
version:    This category is for scripts that are used for advanced versioning.
vuln:       This category is for scripts related to security vulnerabilities
